/*You can add the ability to pass the list of items as an attribute to the component. In React, these attributes are
 called props. When the props of a component are changed in React, the framework automatically re-renders the component.

 The external modifier tells the compiler that the interface's implementation is provided externally, so it doesn't try
  to generate JavaScript code from the declaration.

/*
Defining an onClick function directly as lambda is concise and very useful for prototyping. However, due to the way
equality currently works in Kotlin/JS, performance-wise it's not the most optimized way to pass click handlers.
If you want to optimize rendering performance, consider storing your functions in a variable and passing them
